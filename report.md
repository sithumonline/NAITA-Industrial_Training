# 01 INTRODUCTION – Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies

The Institute was established in 1984 under the name Arthur C Clarke Centre for Modern
Technologies (ACCMT) by an Act of Parliament to accelerate the process of introduction and development of modern technologies in the fields of Communications, Computers, Energy, Space Technologies and Robotics, through the provision of training and research facilities. Basic infrastructure was established in 1986 and the technical activities commenced in early 1987.
